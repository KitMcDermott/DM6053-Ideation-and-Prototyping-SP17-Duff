# Maker Space Training + Laser Cut

Receive training in Maker Space and/or Fablab. Design and laser cut (and/or laser engrave) 3 versions of something. 

This is an opportunity to become acquainted with the laser cutter, and to exercise your ideation skills. Examples of designs which may be laser cut include: logos, business cards, slice-form models for assembly in 3-D, stencils, stamps, drawings/engravings. Materials may include: Cardboard, fabric (verify, possibly only leather), balsa wood, acrylic. You can also incorporate other materials, for example, raster (engrave) on acrylic and then fill in with paint. 

If you are struggling for ideas consider the prompts below:

* redesign the form of a common object. consider how this change would have implications. (for example, redesigning cars would have implications on parking structures)
* Find 4-5 simple objects on the street, in a room, or in a drawer, etc. Place them in new contexts, combine them, play with them, misuse them -- What new ideas are suggested? Use the SCAMPER Technique to come up with ideas for creating something new from each one.
* mash-up of patent drawings 
* puppet, or figure for a stop-motion animation 
* something 3-D, you may consider doing a free trial of Fusion 360 and downloading the free "Slicer for Fusion 360"
* look to Thingiverse for inspiration
* consider shining light through your cut-out, or painting through it or on it
