# Inputs Map

Create a mind map or concept map of all of the various inputs in your life (i.e. this is the total range of what comes into you from outside of your own imagination.) 

Post to your process website. You may have to upload micro and macro views of your map as images. You may also have multiple input maps. Your input map can be literal, conceptual, expressive, artistic, in any medium/style you prefer. It may lead to a useful icon for the "about me" section of your website or portfolio.
